### BREAKING CHANGES

- This commit introduces several breaking changes to improve the library's extensibility and simplicity:

* `resolveAcceptLanguage` is now a named import for better dual (CommonJS/ESM) compatibility.
* `resolveAcceptLanguage` now accepts an `options` argument.
* The `ResolveAcceptLanguage` class has been replaced with `resolveAcceptLanguage` used with the `{ returnMatchType: true }` option.
* Introduced a new match type, `languageSpecificLocale`, for more intelligent matches. See the README for more details.
* Renamed match types for consistency: `localeBased` to `locale`, `languageBased` to `language`, and `relatedLocaleBased` to `relatedLocale`.
